# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
Hello, I built this algorithm visualizer, because I was interested in how sorting algorithms work in real time, so I created a visual representation of a few popular sorting algorithms. I hope this is helpful for the people who have trouble seeing how these algorithms work in action!
