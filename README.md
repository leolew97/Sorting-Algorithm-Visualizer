# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
Hello, I built this algorithm visualizer, because I was interested in how sorting algorithms work in real time, so I created a visual representation of a few popular sorting algorithms. I hope this is helpful for the people who have trouble seeing how these algorithms work in action!

# Available Scripts

In this project directory, you can run:

>**npm run watch** combines our React components and other JavaScript files into a browser performant file. If there are any changes, it'll re-build the file, so we don't have to refresh the page to see new edits. Run in conjunction with **npm run start**.

>**npm run start** runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser. The page reloads if there are any edits made, and we can also see any syntax errors in the console via eslint.

>**npm run build** builds the app for production in the **build** folder. This script optimizes the build for performance. We do not need to use this script if we use **npm run watch**.
